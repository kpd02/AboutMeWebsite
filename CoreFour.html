<h1> The Core Four of Python </h1>

<!-- Loops -->
<h2> Loops </h2>
<h3> Technical Definition </h3>
<p> A for loop allows code written to be cycled through for a specified amount of times,
  and to change every time it is cycled through.
</p>

<!-- Variables -->
<h2> Variables </h2>
<h3> Technical Definition </h3>
<p> Variables are like variables in math. They store values that can be plugged in to different areas of code.
  Variables can be strings or integers, and they can be changed later on in the code.
</p>

<!-- Conditionals -->
<h2> Conditionals </h2>
<h3> Technical Definition </h3>
<p> Conditionals are statements that give the code options to run on. They are like a fork in the road.
  A common example of a conditional statement is an if/else statement. This gives the computer two options of
  code to run, and it chooses which code to run based on a boolean value.
</p>

<!-- Functions -->
<h2> Functions </h2>
<h3> Technical Definition </h3>
<p> Functions are like equations in math. They are pieces of code written with parameters. In later code, variables
are used to replace the parameters and then the code is run with the variables inputed in later code. Functions
return a value, and can be called multiple times in a file. Functions are used as to not have to copy and paste code over
and over again.  </p>
